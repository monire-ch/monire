before: |
  Expenses were tracked manually. Receipts arrived by email and post. Each receipt had to be:
  • Receipts were processed manually with high risk of errors.
  • Files were stored inconsistently across folders.
  • Manual data entry into Excel led to missing receipts and delays.

after: |
  Receipts are now sent via email or Telegram and processed automatically.
  • Images/PDFs are extracted and cleaned via OCR.
  • Date, amount, currency, and vendor are identified with AI.
  • Files are renamed and stored in the correct OneDrive month folder.
  • Data is added into the correct Excel table (EUR or CHF).
  • Everything stays organized & ready for reimbursement review.

  A messy monthly task became a clean, reliable, hands-off workflow.
