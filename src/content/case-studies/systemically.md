before: |
  The team needed a sharper digital presence to communicate their consulting offer:
  • Positioning was not immediately clear on first visit.
  • Navigation and page hierarchy made key services hard to find.
  • The site lacked a strong visual system aligned with the brand.

after: |
  A clearer, premium website experience built around trust and readability.
  • Strong hero message and cleaner information architecture.
  • Service pathways designed for faster decision-making.
  • Consistent visual language across all key sections.

impact: |
  The website now supports credibility and conversion in client conversations.
  • Better first impression and clearer value communication
  • Easier content scanning for busy decision-makers
  • More confident lead generation flow
