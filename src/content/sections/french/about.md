    description: |
      Before founding Moniré, we met as frontend developers at brack.ch, one of Switzerland's largest online retailers. Our paths to tech were unconventional—consulting, HR, and veterinary medicine—and we realized these diverse backgrounds were our shared strength. We don't just write code; we understand business challenges from multiple angles. That's why we founded Moniré: to partner with businesses who need more than technical skills, but genuine care and investment in their growth.
